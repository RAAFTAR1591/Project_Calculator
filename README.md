# Project_Calculator
This is a simple calculator implemented by Arduino UNO, LCD screen and keypad.
Requirements
•Arduino Uno: Arduino is an open-source development platform that allows us to program it
using the Arduino IDE. It contains the Microcontroller ATmega328P. The microcontroller acts
as the Central Processing Unit for the calculator in this project.

•LCD : The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a display device the desire output programmed by
the Programmer. In this project it serves as the display for the calculator. It helps us to enter
the numbers needed to the calculation and then shows us the result. The module used here
follows I2C communication which reduces the number of pins occupied by the LCD.

•Keypad(4x4): This keypad module contains 16 switches inside and through the help of a
matrix, helps us to accept the inputs from the user. It contains all the numbers from 0 to 9
and also contains extra letters such as A,B,C,D. We used this module in order to accept the
numbers from the user and also accept the mathematical operations to be carried out. This
keypad helps us to accept requests from the user without any device in the middle for
example the Serial Monitor in the laptop.
